# 📇 Contact Management System

A simple Python-based Contact Management System that allows users to store and manage contact information with ease. This project was developed to practice Python programming skills, demonstrating how to handle user input, manage data, and perform CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations on contact information stored in a JSON file.

## 💡 Features

- **Add New Contact:** Easily add a contact by entering their name, phone number, and email address.
- **View Contacts:** Display a list of all saved contacts with their details.
- **Edit Existing Contact:** Update the phone number or email address of existing contacts.
- **Delete Contact:** Remove unwanted contacts from the list.
- **Persistent Storage:** Contacts are saved in a JSON file (`contacts.json`) to maintain data even after the program is closed.

## 🚀 How to Use

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/contact-management-system.git
   ```
2. Navigate to the project directory:
   ```bash
   cd contact-management-system
   ```
3. Run the program:
   ```bash
   python contact_manager.py
   ```
   
4. Follow the on-screen instructions to add, view, edit, or delete contacts.

## 📂 Project Structure
